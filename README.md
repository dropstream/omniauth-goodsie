# OmniAuth Goodsie

Shopify OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth 1.0.

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-goodsie'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Goodsie` is simply a Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth 1.0 docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :goodsie, ENV['GOODSIE_API_KEY'], ENV['GOODSIE_SHARED_SECRET'],
          :callback_url => 'http://yourapp.com/auth/goodsie/callback'
end
```

## Configuring

You can configure the scope, which you pass in to the `provider` method via a `Hash`:

* `scope`: A list of permissions you want to request from the user. See the Goodsie API docs for a full list of available permissions: http://goodsie.com/developer/docs/api/authentication#scopes.

For example, to request `storefront`, `cart` and `admin` permissions and display the authentication page:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :goodsie, ENV['GOODSIE_API_KEY'], ENV['GOODSIE_SHARED_SECRET'],
            :scope => 'admin',
            :callback_url => 'http://yourapp.com/auth/goodsie/callback'
end
```

## Authentication Hash

Here's an example *Authentication Hash* available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
  :provider => 'goodsie',
  :credentials => {
    :token => 'afasd923kjh0934kf', # OAuth 2.0 access_token, which you store and use to authenticate API requests
  }
}
```
